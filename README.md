## Online Shopping
The idea for our online shopping website stems from wanting to create a simple shopping experience.  Sites like Amazon are where we got much of the inspiration for the look and funcionality of our website.  At the top of any page, there is a navbar containing buttons that can take the user to the homepage or checkout page.  The homepage consists of various products and detailed information for each product.  Adding a product to the cart is super easy.  A user would just have to click the "add to cart" button corresponding to the product they want to buy.  When the cart button is clicked, the user is taken to the cart webpage.  All items added to the cart will show up on this page.  A "remove" button will remove the adjacent item from the cart, and a "checkout" button will pull up a form for the user to fill out.  This form asks the user for shipping information and can be submitted upon completion.  Products added to the cart are stored in local storage; products removed from the cart are deleted from local storage.

## Tech Stack
We used bootstrap for displaying the product cards on both the main page and the cart page.  Bootstrap was also used for the shipping information form.  A fake store API provided the data for generating the products and their information.  Lastly, we used Font Awesome for animating paws after the checkout form is completed.
